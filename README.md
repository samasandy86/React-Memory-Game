## G.O.A.T Card Memory Game
 
### Game Information

This is a classic game of memory. The user needs to click on each card to display one image. Next they will click on another image to see if it matches. If the card matches they images will stay revealed. If not, the images will flip back over and the user can try again. The user gets as many tries as they would like. 

When the user clicks the restart button the images randomize and the game refreshes.
